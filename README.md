# Webiste-Design-Project
Repository for Web Design Term Project

The following code was part of the term project that I had with a Web Design course during my
Bachelor's Degree program for Information Technology at USF (minus the images that
were used with it).

The project was mostly a summation of all of the lessons that were learned over
the course of the class. Having learned how to code HTML and CSS code, as well as
some Javascript code, we were tasking with putting everything together and create
a functioning webpage that could be run with any internet browser.
The only major stipulation was that specific pages were required (like a calender)
as well as a desired number of pages (5).

We were given about a month to accomplish the project. I decided first to
work on the project after I had dealt with more immediate assignments, which
meant that this project was worked on usually over the weekend, and occassionally
on weekdays depending on work volume. For the most part, I spent careful time
reviewing the textbook for the class as I wrote the coding, and taking stock of
what particular images and other requirements I needed. As I completed code,
I would test how the html files looked by loading them into Firefox,
and fixing them based on any issues preceived. I would also sometimes ask the
teacher if I came across a problem that I could not work out on my own.

The end result ended being a functional website that displayed content
related to my own Youtube channel (Gaiacrusher9). The website has 5 pages in all:

1) A Home Page
2) An About Me Page
3) Content Page (with links to various Youtube playlists)
4) A Calender (showing when uploads would occur for the month)
5) A Friends Page (links to friend accounts)

Overall, the project was a fitting and satisfying conclusion to my web
design course. Being able to create a functional website that could also
benefit my own Youtube channel was very fulfilling, and a project that
I was able to enjoy overall.
