			<p>Online, I go by the moniker of Gaiacrusher9, or Gaia for short, but IRL, I’m Autumn, 
			a 26 year-old nerd, currently pursuing a Bachelor’s in Information Technology, but 
			playing a bunch of games in the meanwhile. I started my Youtube channel back on 
			May 16th, 2009, a fresh-faced and very shy boy who had just started a degree in 
			Bio-Medical Sciences, and was encouraged by my friends (and fellow Youtube content creators) 
			to try my hand at the world of Let’s Plays.</p>

			<p>“Wait though”, you ask, “A boy?” Beyond the adorable mascot that I’ve used since the 
			inception of my channel (something that came of a habit of drawing cat faces, and
			discovering a certain item in Gaia Online), one of my most distinguishing features is that I am a 
			Male-to-Female Transsexual! I began seeking counseling back in 2011, began medically 
			transitioning a few months after, and completed my Sexual Reassignment Surgery back in 
			March of 2013. Because of these experiences, I even made a short series on Youtube detailing 
			some information about the whole transitioning process! If you ever have any questions, 
			feel free to ask me, I love talking about it all. I’m also a Type 1 Diabetic too, so if 
			you ever need someone to talk to about that as well, I’m more than happy to help :D</p>

			<p>My Youtube channel primarily deals with Let’s Play Playthroughs of various video games 
			from across all kinds of platforms and generations. From LEGO games, to RPGs, to even the 
			more odd-ball games like Chibi-Robo, I strive to create quality content (if maybe abit 
			mature at certain times) while simply trying to be myself and have a good time with both 
			the games and my audience at large. I also occasionally branch out to make more silly content 
			videos, and have been working to incorporate more things into my channel, such as content 
			that I run in multiplayer games such as Final Fantasy XIV (Autumn Dawn on Ultros, if 
			you’re ever curious enough), and hopefully even streaming on Twitch in the future!</p>
